An unordered list of what makes me feel alive.

- Sitting in the sun with no where to go
- Reading outside
- Reading inside while it rains outside
- Walking without a purpose
- Navigating on experience instead of GPS
- Remembering the name of someone I just met
- Running as exploration
- Squatting and deadlifting heavy weights with good form
- Cooking at home
- Dancing in the kitchen to salsa
- Eating a balanced meal
- Watching a sunset with friends
- Embracing the cold in a cold shower
- Melting in a hot bath
