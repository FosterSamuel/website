Stress around food storage can stop us from cooking a new recipe or from enjoying leftovers. To change this I am tracking how to store each kind of food. 

Each method is based on my own reading and experiences, and I recommend seeking [reviewed literature](#reviewed-literature) if looking for health and safety rigor.

- [Carrots, chopped](#carrots-chopped)
- [Carrots, raw](#carrots-raw)
- [Herbs](#herbs)

### Carrots, chopped

1. Wash and dry carrots
2. Fill container with an inch of water
3. Put carrots in water and place lid on container
4. Every 3-5 days drain the water and refill
5. Store in fridge for up to 3 weeks

### Carrots, raw
Optionally, green ends can be snipped off and [stored as hardy herbs.](#loose-herbs)

1. Do not wash
2. Wipe dust and residue water off carrots
3. Place carrots in airtight bag or container with clean kitchen towel 
4. Store in fridge for up to 3 months



### Herbs

Hardy herbs like Chives, Rosemary, Sage, Savory, and Thyme:
1. Wash and dry herbs
2. Separate dry herbs onto a damp paper towel
3. Roll paper towel over each herb, creating a swirl
4. Place wrapped herbs in airtight airtight bag or container
5. Store in fridge for 1 to 3 weeks

Tender herbs like Basil, Cilantro, Dill, Mint, Parsely, and Tarragon:
1. Snip off stem bottoms
2. Pluck wilted leaves
3. Put herbs in jar with an inch of water
4. Cover jar with lid or rubber-band-sealed plastic bag
5. Store in fridge for 1 to 3 weeks

### Reviewed Literature
The Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources at UNL has a page on [food storage](https://food.unl.edu/free-resource/food-storage). Also, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services runs foodsafety.gov, which has [helpful tips on food safety](https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep-food-safe/4-steps-to-food-safety).
