### Empire of Pain by Patrick Radden Keefe

Wild ride showing the Sackler family was both accidentally and purposefully positioned for the creation of OxyContin and the fueling of the opoid crisis. Not a word is wasted. I recommend [the book.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109-empire-of-pain) 


### KING SEJONG THE GREAT by Joe Menosky

Formatting errors aside, [the book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55858498-king-sejong-the-great) was a whirlwind historical fiction about King Sejong's dangerous move to create the Korean alphabet for the people, for anyone. I found it compelling and it planted a seed of interest in learning the alphabet. Would recommend.
