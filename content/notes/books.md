Thoughts on books read.

### KING SEJONG THE GREAT by Joe Menosky
Finished first read on Dec 18, 2022.

Formatting errors aside, [the book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55858498-king-sejong-the-great) was a whirlwind historical fiction about King Sejong's dangerous move to create the Korean alphabet for the people, for anyone. I found it compelling and it planted a seed of interest in learning the alphabet. Would recommend.
