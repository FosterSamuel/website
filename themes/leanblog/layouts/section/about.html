	<p>I wanted to make video games. At ten years old I found Roblox, a website for playing and making 3D games with the Lua scripting language. Coding left me clueless and dazzled. I failed repeatedly to make a game, but the joy of programming never stopped.</p>
	<p>I continued learning with Liberty BASIC and eventually Java. I branched out by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a freelancer I built and designed websites for five years. Those years saw me through a computer science degree from Cal Poly Pomona.</p>

	<p>With four friends I founded the on-campus Software Engineering Association. We pushed fellow students to, practically and continuously, build their skills.</p>
	<p>I now work as a software engineer at Microsoft.</p>
